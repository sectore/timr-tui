# Contributing

Any feedback / contribution are welcome. Just open an `issue`, a `PR` or start a `discussion`.

## Code style / conventions

- Try to write [clean, idiomatic Rust code](https://github.com/mre/idiomatic-rust).
- Keep code [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) whenever it makes sense.
- Before pushing any code make sure to run `clippy` and `fmt`. Check provided [`just`](./jusfile) file to run such commands, [CI](https://github.com/sectore/timr-tui/blob/main/.github/workflows/ci.yml) will do the same.
- Have fun to write code.

## Design files

Use [Figma Design file](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1553076532392275586/timr-tui) to suggest design changes

## AI

Always understand what AI provides to you. Never push any code based on [`vibe coding`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibe_coding) you or anybody else can't follow. Make sure your agent still follows all code styles and conventions suggested above. Use AI for better, not for worse code.
