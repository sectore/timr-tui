# Code Guidelines

- Idiomatic Rust everywhere
- DRY whenever it makes sense
- Rare or no comments are preferred instead of commenting everything which the code already describes
- Keep tests compact and simple

# Agent Guidelines

- Keep your answers compact, but explicit. An user will ask if something is missing.
- For complex tasks provide a plan.
- Structure plans as small as possible.
- Solve complex problems step by step, never all at once.
- Act as a pair programmer, not as a vibe-coding provider. That's an user should guide you, not the opposite. Always ask if something is not clear to you.
